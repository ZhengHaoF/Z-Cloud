# Z-Cloud

Z-Cloud web side

#### Introduction

According to IDC's forecast, the amount of data generated worldwide will exceed 40ZB in 2020, which is equivalent to 5200GB of data generated by every person on earth.

Even after removing unnecessary files, such a huge amount of data is still very large!

How many photos of your childhood have been lost? How many cell phone albums have you cleaned up with pain?

From 2016 when 360 cloud disk stopped personal services to date, large and small cloud storage services either limit the speed or limit the space

The reason for this is simply that the cost of storage is too high, and we have no choice but to do so. As consumers, how do we find the most affordable cloud storage services?

Only from the root, we rent object storage to build their own cloud disk, leaving aside all unnecessary costs, in order to reduce the price.

So that brings us to Z-Cloud
